<div id="main">
<p>In the past one decade, there has been an exponential surge in the
online activity of people across the globe. The volume of posts that are
made on the web every second runs into millions. To add to this, the
rise of social media platforms has led to flooding to content on the
internet.</p>
<p>Social media is not just a platform where people talk to each other,
but it has become very vast and serves many more purposes. It has become
a medium where people</p>
<ul>
<li>Express their interests.</li>
<li>Share their views.</li>
<li>Share their displeasures.</li>
<li>Compliment companies for good and poor services.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in this lecture, we are going to learn how we can gather, analyze
and present what <em>users</em> are posting on <em>Twitter</em> to come
up with insight for Policy communication strategies or other types of
Public health strategies.</p>
<div id="apply-for-a-twitter-developer-account" class="section level1">
<h1>1. Apply for a Twitter Developer Account</h1>
<p>You’ll need a <strong>Twitter Developer</strong> account since it
gives you access to a personalized API key, which we will need later on.
This key is unique to every account, so you mustn’t share it.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://developer.twitter.com/">Twitter Developer</a>
and create an account. You can use the same login credentials to your
personal Twitter account if you’d like.</p>
<p>You will need to apply for an account, so make sure to follow the
steps. It may take some time to set up the account, as there are a few
questions you’ll need to answer. Most questions require a decent amount
of input, so answer it to the best of your ability. How to create the
Twitter app?</p>
<p>Twitter has made the task of analyzing tweets posted by users easier
by developing an API which people can use to extract tweets and
underlying metadata. This API helps us extract twitter data in a very
structured format which can then be cleaned and processed further for
analysis.</p>
<p>To create a Twitter app, you first need to have a Twitter account.
Once you have created a Twitter account, visit Twitter’s app page and
create an application.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-a-twitter-api-app" class="section level1">
<h1>2. Create a Twitter API App</h1>
<p>It could take some time to get approved for a Developer account.
However, after the approval, look at the top right of the navigation bar
and select apps to create an app that is part of generating an API
key.</p>

<p>Twitter rate limits cap the number of search results returned to
18,000 every 15 minutes. To request more than that, set
<em>retryonratelimit = TRUE</em> and rtweet will wait for rate limit
resets for you. For more details about the Twitter’s API package
<em>(rtweet)</em> visit the page <a
href="https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet"
class="uri">https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet</a> where all the details
to gather tweets are provided!</p>

To use his terminology, BQ.1.1 might be that game-changer.","7) Yet despite the risk schools can pose in this #pandemic, the start of an 8th wave in Quebec, the emergence of a troubling new #Omicron subvariant and a likely early flu season, the public somehow does not have the right to updates on student and staff #COVID absences.","1) More than two weeks after I drew attention to the fact that the Quebec Education Ministry was sitting on data it was collecting on #COVID absences among students, La Presse journalist @marieevemo succeeded in obtaining some figures. https://t.co/pzUuHqnFJK","4) For months now, the BA.5 subvariant of #Omicron has predominated in Quebec. But in the past six weeks, Omicron's predominance has slipped from 80% of #COVID samples tested in August to 78.1% last week. In contrast, BQ.1.1 is gaining in Quebec, as it is in the rest of Canada.","10) Commendably, Quebec Health Minister Christian Dubé (@cdube) has made all sorts of #COVID data public. Such disclosure is the envy of people in other jurisdictions. Then why not simply resume at least weekly updates on student #COVID absences? End of thread.","5) Among the other #Omicron subvariants that are being tested by Quebec authorities, the chart below shows BQ.1.1 has been gaining in circulation the most sharply in the province. On Sept. 17, BQ.1.1 comprised 0.04% of other #COVID samples tested and by Oct. 8, it rose to 4.4%. https://t.co/qzmanrJUan","2) #Cerberus, an offshoot of the #Omicron variant, is also known as BQ.1.1. One of the world's top #COVID experts, Dr. Eric Topol, warned in a tweet last week that BQ.1.1, \"with marked immune evasive properties,\" is likely to be \"the principal driver of (the) next U.S. wave.\" https://t.co/soE8tyRqN7","9) In the meantime, with B.Q.1.1 prevalence still very low in Quebec, the province nonetheless reported 2,085 #COVID hospitalizations on Wednesday. On the same date last year, there were 297 hospitalizations in what was then clearly a plateau. Please see below. https://t.co/9o8hr7huv3","4) Morasse noted in her excellent article today that Quebec authorities have also decided not to make public absences due to #COVID among school staff. If data on absences among health workers can be made public, why not education employees, too?","3) All the latest #COVID data indicators — from wastewater samples to hospitalizations — are showing Quebec is now in the midst of an 8th wave. We're getting daily updates on health workers who are absent. But we're not getting them for elementary and high school students.","1) Breaking: As #COVID hospitalizations in Quebec climbed to their highest level Wednesday since Aug. 9, evidence is emerging that the new \"Cerberus\" subvariant is beginning to invade the province, especially in the Montreal area. In this thread, I will examine the implications.","5) In my earlier Twitter thread today, I noted that a worrisome new #Omicron subvariant, #Cerberus or BQ.1.1, is gaining traction in Quebec in this 8th wave. That makes daily #COVID data all the more essential.   https://t.co/Tf3V44RUui","11) Far too many health workers are on preventive medical leave due to #COVID, 3,905 to be exact. That's down from just over 4,000 last week, but those absences are still high enough to signal the enormous pressure that Quebec hospitals are now under, especially in their ERs. https://t.co/LgtjrJpc6m","6) Studies by researchers in Quebec and abroad have  shown that contrary to the spin by politicians and even some public health experts, schools can indeed be vectors for #COVID transmission. Please click on the link to this Italian study: https://t.co/bxLd3v81kZ","9) Many followers of my threads have commented on their desire to know about #COVID school absences — whether they are going up or down — to make informed decisions about their children. Some followers have even filed access-to-information requests with the government.","10) For the #COVID minimizers out there, please note that a month ago, 499 people were hospitalized in Quebec for #COVID directly, and of that number, 18 were receiving intensive care.

<p><strong>Top emoji</strong></p>
<p>To identify the most used emoji we can use the
<strong>ji_extract_all()</strong> function from the <em>emo</em>
package. This function extracts all the emojis from the text of each
tweet. We can then use the unnest() function from the tidyvers package
to split out the emojis, count, sort in descending order and identify
the top 10</p>

<h1>5. Sentiment analysis</h1>
<p>When human readers approach a text, we use our understanding of the
emotional intent of words to infer whether a section of text is positive
or negative, or perhaps characterized by some other more nuanced emotion
like surprise or disgust. We can use the tools of text mining to
approach the emotional content of text programmatically, as shown in
Figure</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tidytextmining.com/images/tmwr_0201.png" width="50%" /></p>
<p>One way to analyze the sentiment of a text is to consider the text as
a combination of its individual words and the sentiment content of the
whole text as the sum of the sentiment content of the individual words.
The <em>tidytext</em> package provides access to several sentiment
lexicons, nd in particular the <em>syuzhet</em> allows the use of
several lexicons for the emotions measurement like:</p>

<div id="topic-modeling" class="section level1">
<h1>6. Topic modeling</h1>
<p>Topic modeling is a methodology for unsupervised classification,
similar to the clustering methods numeric data, which finds natural
groups of items across a set of documents. Topic Modeling is used to
discover “latent” topics in a given selection of documents. Topic models
are particularly common in text mining to unearth hidden semantic
structures in textual data.Topic models are also referred to as
probabilistic topic models, which refers to statistical algorithms for
discovering the latent semantic structures of an extensive text body One
of the most popular topic models is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) <a
href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf">Blei et
al. 2003</a>.</p>
<p>LDA is a particularly popular method for fitting a topic model. It
treats each document as a mixture of topics, and each topic as a mixture
of words. This allows documents to “overlap” each other in terms of
content, rather than being separated into discrete groups, in a way that
mirrors typical use of natural language.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YptrZXJ/1-Rcy-Xi1l-MESMq3-X-RC7b-L0-Q.png" width="50%" /></p>
<p><strong>Ok.. LDA is not the easiest thing to understand at first
glance…</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.gifer.com/75Ez.gif" width="50%" /></p>
<p>Without diving into the math behind the model, we can understand it
as being guided by two principles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Every document is a mixture of topics. We imagine that each
document may contain words from several topics in particular
proportions. For example, in a two-topic model we could say “Document 1
is 90% topic A and 10% topic B, while Document 2 is 30% topic A and 70%
topic B.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Every topic is a mixture of words. For example, we could
imagine a two-topic model of American news, with one topic for
“politics” and one for “entertainment.” The most common words in the
politics topic might be “President”, “Congress”, and “government”, while
the entertainment topic may be made up of words such as “movies”,
“television”, and “actor”. Importantly, words can be shared between
topics; a word like “budget” might appear in both equally.</em></p></li>

estimate uncertainty, and visualize quantities of interest. Below an <a

<h2>6.5 Estimating metadata/topic relationships</h2>
<p>Estimating the relationship between metadata and topics is a core
feature of the stm package. This function explores how prevalence of
topics varies across documents according to the dataset covariates
(metadata). The estimateEffect can calculate uncertainty in several
ways. The default is “Global”, which will incorporate estimation
uncertainty of the topic proportions into the uncertainty estimates
using the method of composition.</p>
